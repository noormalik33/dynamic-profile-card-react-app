# 🌟 Dynamic Profile Card React App

A responsive and interactive profile card system built in React! This app showcases a list of Pakistani actors, allowing users to follow/unfollow, search by name, and toggle between light/dark mode. Includes login/signup functionality and a history log — all beautifully styled with Tailwind CSS.
